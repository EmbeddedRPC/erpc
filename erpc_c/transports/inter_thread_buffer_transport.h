 * @brief Very basic transport to send/receive messages between threads.
 *
 * Can send and receive message buffers to/from another instance of the same class
 * associated with another thread. Only one other thread may be communicated with. To set
 * things up first create two instances. Then call the linkWithPeer() method on the
 * first one, passing the second. The two instances of this class do not have to be
 * created on their respective threads, but the send() and receive() calls must be
 * invoked on the appropriate thread.
 *
 * Only a single message may be pending for each of the two threads. If a message is
 * pending for a thread and another is sent, then the sender will block until the
 * currently pending message is received.
