 * @brief Base class for framed transport layers.
 *
 * This class adds simple framing to the data transmitted and received on the
 * communications channel. This allows the transport to perform reads and writes
 * of a size known in advance. Subclasses must implement the underlyingSend() and
 * underlyingReceive() methods to actually transmit and receive data.
 *
 * Frames have a maximum size of 64kB, as a 16-bit frame size is used.
 *
 * @note This implementation currently assumes both sides of the communications channel
 *  are the same endianness.
 *
 * The frame header includes a CRC-16 over the data for integrity checking. This class
 * includes a default CRC-16 implementation that is optimized for code size, but is
 * relatively slow. If a faster implementation is desired, you can pass the new CRC
 * function to setCRCFunction().
