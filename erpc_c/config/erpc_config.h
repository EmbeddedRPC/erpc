//! Set to one of the @c ERPC_THREADS_x macros to specify the threading model used by eRPC.
//!
//! Leave commented out to attempt to auto-detect. Auto-detection works well for pthreads.
//! FreeRTOS can be detected when building with compilers that support __has_include().
//! Otherwise, the default is no threading.

//! Uncomment to change the size of buffers allocated by BasicMessageBufferFactory in the client
