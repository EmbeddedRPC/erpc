//! @brief Select threading model.
//!
//! Set to one of the @c ERPC_THREADS_x macros to specify the threading model used by eRPC.
//!
//! Leave commented out to attempt to auto-detect. Auto-detection works well for pthreads.
//! FreeRTOS can be detected when building with compilers that support __has_include().
//! Otherwise, the default is no threading.
//#define ERPC_THREADS (ERPC_THREADS_FREERTOS)

//! @def ERPC_DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE
//!
//! Uncomment to change the size of buffers allocated by BasicMessageBufferFactory in the client
//! and server setup functions (@ref client_setup and @ref server_setup). The default size is 256.
